<FONT SIZE="5">The West Bengal Joint Entrance Examination Board <A HREF="https://wbjeeb.nic.in/#">(WBJEEB)</A> has delayed the release of the WBJEE 2025 results, causing growing anxiety among one lakh candidates.<BR>
As per past year trends, the results are typically declared within 20 to 48 days after the exam. This year, the exam was held on April 28, and based on previous timelines, the result was expected in late May or early June. However, the delay has continued into July.<BR>
According to a report by Times Now, the results are currently on hold due to the Calcutta High Court’s interim stay on the revised OBC reservation list, which will remain in effect until July 31.<FONT>
